# EWatches
Information, firmware and code for nRF52 wsmart atches running Espruino

This site is intended to supplement the good work done by many other far more creative and ingenious minds out there. Any code you find here will be to just get a watch off the ground, or piggyback off some already written software (which will be referenced), so no guarantees of completeness or even durability! I'm learning this as I go, and I get bored and move on quickly, so feel free to take what you find here and run with it.

## What is an EWatch
A term I just made up because it's short and easy to type. What I mean is an off-the-shelf smart watch (available from many sources worldwide, but my favourite source is aliexpress.com) which is capable of being reprogrammed to run [Espruino](https://espruino.com). At the time of writing, only watches that have a Nordic nRF52832 or nRF52840 are supported. They fall into two categories: updateable over-the-air (OTA) via BLE or updateable via SWD (https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0031/a/The-Serial-Wire-Debug-Port--SW-DP-/Introduction-to-the-ARM-Serial-Wire-Debug--SWD--protocol#:~:text=for%20your%20feedback-,Introduction%20to%20the%20ARM%20Serial%20Wire%20Debug%20(SWD)%20protocol,asynchronously%2C%20for%20minimum%20pin%20count)
