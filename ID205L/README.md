Basic drivers for the ID205L smartwatch (nrf52840 8MB SPI flash, 240x240 ST7789 LCD, IT7259 touchscreen, unknown accelerometer)

This is very much WIP. Massive work was already done by @kvasdopil, so a big thanks to him (and @fanoush, @atc1441, et al)

So far, this is based upon the regular Espruino build stream, no custom code. @kvasdopil made a fast LCD driver using EasyDMA, but his build is quite old
so I'm trying to get it more in line with modern Espruino. 

WIP. more to come.
