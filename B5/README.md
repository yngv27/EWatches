This is code for the SMA B5 smart band. Full information avaiable [(]here](https://github.com/fanoush/ds-d6/tree/master/espruino/DFU/B5). This is using a custom firmware that has an unbuffered, 16-bit SPI driver built-in. Slower to draw than @fanoush's code, but lots of colours available to fancy up this little band.

Work in progress to get a functioning (likely basic and inaccurate) step counter.
