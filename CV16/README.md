This is for the ancient and no longer available CV16 smartwatch. Easily upgradeable via ATC1441's DaFlasher and upgrade firmware (following the P8 process). 
This watch stands out in that it has an I2C RGB LED (SGM31324) that can be set to blink and pulse to many colours, and a segmented LCD on top of the RGB LCD for a lower power,
always-on basic watch.

Included here is an Espruino firmware which sets the two buttons (hard and soft), startup script to set up the accelerometer and LCD(s), and some sample code for 
working the atypical hardware.
